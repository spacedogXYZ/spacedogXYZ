It's the end of an era. 2021 was our last year as Spacedog. To recap, we


- developed our photography skills with courses in [Death Valley](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2021/03/13/death-valley-2021) and the [Eastern Sierras](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2021/10/09/sierra-foliage)
- drove to Utah for some epic [mountain biking in Moab](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2021/05/14/mountain-biking-moab) and photography in Arches National Park
- escaped the Sierra summer smoke with a [trip along the coast](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2021/09/12/escape-to-the-coast), and watched nervously as flames licked Lake Tahoe through September
- coached Truckee high school's [robotics team](https://www.instagram.com/truckeerobotics/), opening young minds to engineering management and the wonders of Gantt charts
- wrote to our [local paper](https://www.moonshineink.com/opinion/responding-to-covid-controversy/) about the importance of everyone getting the COVID vaccine
- helped [TeamSeas raise $30m](/mission/teamseas) to clean up the world's oceans, rivers and beaches
- CallPower campaigns saved a man from execution in Oklahoma, connected thousands to congress to [act on climate](/mission/call4climate) and stopped another bad internet bill from becoming law
- joined [ImpactObservatory](/mission/impactobservatory/) in 2022 to build AI-powered geospatial monitoring tools to help save the planet

Spacedog will be on hiatus for awhile, but [CallPower](https://callpower.org/) and [OpenSourceActivism tech](https://opensourceactivism.tech) live on! These tools continue to be <strong>free as in speech</strong>, and we hope that others will find our code and approach useful.

<em>Ad astra, per aspera.</em>
