It's the end of an era. 2021 was our last year as Spacedog. To recap, we

- worked with [TeamSeas](/mission/teamseas/) to raise $30m for the ocean
- developed our photography skills with courses in [Death Valley](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2021/03/13/death-valley-2021) and the [Eastern Sierras](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2021/10/09/sierra-foliage)
- drove to Utah for some epic [mountain biking in Moab](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2021/05/14/mountain-biking-moab) and photography in Arches National Park
- escaped the Sierra summer smoke with a [trip along the coast](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2021/09/12/escape-to-the-coast), and watched nervously as flames licked Lake Tahoe through September
- joined [ImpactObservatory](/mission/impactobservatory/) in 2022 to build AI-powered AI-powered geospatial monitoring tools to help save the planet
