Oof, 2020 was a whole mood. To recap, we:

- worked with [VoteAmerica](/mission/voteamerica/) to build a brand new voter registration system from the ground up in six months
- moved from sunny Oakland to snowy Truckee, CA, where we quarantined in the mountains during the global pandemic
- continued to provide CallPower for the ActionPAC, who connected over 800,000 [calls to end police violence](/mission/police-violence/) in May and June
- rebuilt and launched [Crush2020](/mission/crush2020) in September and October and released the underlying code and data as open source
- helped dispel election misinformation with [Common Cause](/mission/common-cause/) and provided counter-narratives with [Count Every Vote](/mission/count-every-vote/) in November
- watched in horror in January 2021 as the nation's capitol suffered insurrectionary violence and right-wing terrorism
- gratefully received a first dose of the Moderna vaccine in late March 2021, finally closing the chapter on one helluva year
