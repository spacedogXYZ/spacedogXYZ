After seven years of incredible projects around the world, we are signing off. Commander Levinger is returning to his roots in space science and geographic nerdery, joining the team at Impact Observatory as a full-stack engineer. He will be working on their mapping platform covering global land use, climate change and biodiversity. We will continue to support our open source activism code, but will no longer be accepting new client work.

Onward, to the stars.
