Call4Climate was launched last month by Leah Stokes, an energy researcher at the University of California, Santa Barbara, along with Duncan Meisel and Jamie Henn, co-founders of the Clean Creatives campaign.

“There are so many people out there who are freaked out about the climate crisis right now,” said Henn. “They’re seeing wildfires, heatwaves, flooding, and wondering what they can do about it. We wanted to provide a simple, direct way that anyone in the country could make a difference.”

To that end, the three created a dial-in number *(202)-318-1885* that people can use to easily hit up their senators. Once you call the number, a voice asks you to punch in your zip code. When you do, it reminds you to make four demands for a bold climate bill.
