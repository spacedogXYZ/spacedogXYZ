description: 2021 was a vibe
---

2021 was a vibe. To recap, we:

- enjoyed a brief lull of COVID concerns just in time for hot girl summer
- got second and third doses of Moderna, and wrote to our [local paper](https://www.moonshineink.com/opinion/responding-to-covid-controversy/) about the importance of everyone getting the vaccine
- coached Truckee high school's [robotics team](https://www.instagram.com/truckeerobotics/), opening young minds to engineering management and the wonders of Gantt charts
- helped [TeamSeas raise $30m](/mission/teamseas) to clean up the world's oceans, rivers and beaches
- CallPower campaigns saved a man from execution in Oklahoma, connected thousands to congress to [act on climate](/mission/call4climate) and stopped [another bad internet bill](/mission/crypto) from becoming law
- searched for several months for a full-time job, and eventually landed one at an organization we are proud to join. 

Spacedog will be on hiatus for awhile, but [CallPower](https://callpower.org/) and [OpenSourceActivism tech](https://opensourceactivism.tech) live on! These tools continue to be <strong>free as in speech</strong>, and we hope that others will find our code and approach useful.

<em>Ad astra, per aspera.</em>
