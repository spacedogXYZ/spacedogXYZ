When MrBeast passed 20 million followers on YouTube, the Internet challenged him to plant 20 million trees in celebration. This sparked the greatest collaboration of YouTube creators in history, releasing simultaneous videos to their combined subscriber base on launch day and raising over $5m on the first weekend alone. #TeamTrees was trending on Twitter in the US, just behind Kanye (who also dropped a new album) but ahead of Kenny G.

We were brought in as a technology consultant to help the site withstand the massive traffic influx on launch day, optimize the social share experience, and lay the groundwork for ongoing organizing with best-in-class tools and tactics. We are proud to stand with Team Trees to prove the power of the internet for good, and to head into 2020 on a positive note for the world.
