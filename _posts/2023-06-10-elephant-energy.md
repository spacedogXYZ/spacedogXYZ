After two great years at IO, I left to join a friend's climate-tech startup based in Denver. Elephant Energy has helped thousands of homeowners electrify their biggest investment, installing heat pumps, EV chargers, and super-efficient water heaters. As Founding Engineer, I will help accelerate their progress and build software to scale with their ambitions.

Let's go!
